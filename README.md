- 👋 Hi, I’m @birkh88
- 👀 I’m interested in any solution that can change the World in real, may it be a software, a behaviour, a technique or philosophy. I read and was very interested about ecocentrism, a philosophy or perspective that places intrinsic value on all living organisms and their natural environment, regardless of their perceived usefulness or importance to human beings...and I think it should, for humans utmost interest, guide their life. The greed that lead the World to its demise and we are the only beings able to conduct changes with planned results at the global scale.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything that can satisfy that purpose and I am open to any suggestions.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on several projects related to that end. First of all, it is a fact that politics in this world is failing, not ble to make real and important decisions any longer. I am looking for people crazy enough to think that a peaceful solution is possible to come from the people.
